My approach is to for every word, binary search. I would be using the compareTo method in order to compare the strings. |

It would have a startup cost, where I grab the indices of the start of each letter. I will upgrade the list from a 2d to 3d for trials to see which is more efficient. |
| September 26 | 0500-0530  |                                               I completed my startup function which creates a map that is a 2d array of ints each with length 26. I do this by looping through the dictionary and when the current prefix doesn't equal the last prefix set i to the new suffix's spot in the map. Initially I had it add one everytime things changed, but when I looked at the small dictionary I realized that was wrong. |

I also made my main binary search loop. There is one exception where if the second letter is z, then I have to change the parameters for binary search. Right now my it is in an infinite loop |
| September 28 | 0915-0945  | My main problem with my loop was the way I was instantiating end. I was assuming that every possible two letter prefix exists. I fix that by iterating on my list of possible prefixes until I find one that is not zero. Then I realized this creates an edge case where a word like aaardvark is counted as incorrect so I am no instantiating each of suffixs initially at -1. This has led to many out of bounds errors. |

Then, I reordered some if statements around to see if it would change my code. There was one instance where an if statement was triggering,but whenI did it out it shouldn't have. |

I created starters for the insert and find. I am doing it recursively where I chop off a letter each time for both of them. |
