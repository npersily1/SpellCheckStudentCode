My approach is to for every word, binary search. I would be using the compareTo method in order to compare the strings. |

It would have a startup cost, where I grab the indices of the start of each letter. I will upgrade the list from a 2d to 3d for trials to see which is more efficient. |
| September 26 | 0500-0530  | I completed my startup function which creates a map that is a 2d array of ints each with length 26. I do this by looping through the dictionary and when the current prefix doesn't equal the last prefix set i to the new suffix's spot in the map. Initially I had it add one everytime things changed, but when I looked at the small dictionary I realized that was wrong. |
